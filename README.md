# Digital Clock using Python

This is my first Python GUI project made using Tkinter.  
The application shows the current time and date in a digital clock format.

I added a 12-hour / 24-hour format option and a greeting message that changes
according to the time of day.

## Features
- Live digital clock with seconds
- 12-hour and 24-hour time format toggle
- Time-based greeting (morning, afternoon, evening)
- Simple dark-themed interface

## Tools Used
- Python
- Tkinter
- time module

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open terminal in the project folder
3. Run the file using:
```bash
python Digitalclock.py
```
